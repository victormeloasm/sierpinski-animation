## Sierpinski Triangle Animation in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script to generate a Sierpinski Triangle animation. The animation is created by iteratively drawing triangles based on the Sierpinski triangle fractal pattern. The script allows you to customize the number of iterations and the animation speed.

### Prerequisites

To run the script, you'll need MATLAB installed on your computer. MATLAB provides powerful tools for numerical computation, visualization, and data analysis.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/victormeloasm/sierpinski-animation.git
   cd sierpinski-animation
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `sierpinski-animation` directory.

### Running the Animation

1. Open the `sierpinski_triangle.m` script in MATLAB.

2. Modify the script's parameters if desired:
   - `L`: Side length of the initial triangle.
   - `it`: Number of iterations for the Sierpinski Triangle construction.
   - `video_fps`: Desired FPS for the output video.
   - `frame_pause`: Time interval between animation frames.

3. Run the script by clicking the "Run" button or typing `sierpinski_triangle_animation_to_mp4` in the MATLAB command window.

4. The script will generate an animation and save it as `sierpinski_animation.mp4` in the same directory.
